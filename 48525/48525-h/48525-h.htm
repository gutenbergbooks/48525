<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>


<p>I trust that this chronicle of the chief events of the war
will prove a useful and an interesting record. It has been
decided to omit maps, because their inclusion within
bounds less than cumbersome would prove practically
worthless. The number of towns, as opposed to villages,
which were definitely connected with the war is surprisingly
small, and their locality is known to nearly every one.
The great majority of places which the war has brought
into prominence are villages so small that they are marked
only in maps of an exceptionally large scale. What is
required, therefore, for adequate study of the topography
of the war, is either a moderate number of maps of great
size or a far larger and confusing number less bulky but
each covering only a small area. As the inclusion of either
would necessitate a detached and cumbrous volume, I have
in its absence taken pains to indicate accurately the position
of every place whose locality might be unfamiliar.</p>

<p>In the following pages the names given to the battles,
and the dates on which they began and ended, are from
sources either official or authoritative. The same may be
said of the strategical or tactical aims or results which I
have in some cases noted&mdash;particularly in 1918.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span></p>

<p>As appendices I have chosen the four documents most
closely connected with the outbreak of the war (the
Austrian ultimatum to Serbia, Serbia's reply, and Germany's
declarations of war on Russia and France), President
Wilson's 'Fourteen Points,' and the chief instruments
in the restoration of peace, <i>i.e.</i> the terms of Armistice with
the Central Powers and the Treaty of Versailles. The
text of this last is so long, and concerned with so many
small matters of detail, that I have thought it best to represent
it by a short summary of its main provisions. An
exception has, however, been made in the case of its very
important Military, Naval, and Aerial Clauses, which are
given in the fuller form of the official précis.</p>

<p>In cross-references, where no year is given the reference
is to the same year as the entry referenced.</p>

<p>I am indebted to Mr. A. D. L. Cary, Librarian of the
Royal United Service Institution, for an introduction to
certain valuable records not readily accessible. I have
also to thank the Librarian of the Admiralty for his
assistance in connection with the dates of various naval
incidents.</p>

barrier of the Ardennes. The pursuit of the
beaten enemy all along the Allied line was only
stopped by the Armistice.</p>

<h2><a name="APPENDIX_I" id="APPENDIX_I">APPENDIX I</a></h2>

<h3>AUSTRIA'S ULTIMATUM TO SERBIA</h3>


<p>The Austro-Hungarian Government addressed the following
Note to the Serbian Government on the 23rd July 1914,
through the medium of the Austro-Hungarian Minister at
Belgrade:</p>

<p>'On the 31st March 1909 the Serbian Minister in Vienna,
on the instructions of the Serbian Government, made the following
declaration to the Imperial and Royal Government:</p>

<p>'"Serbia recognises that the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fait accompli</i> regarding Bosnia
has not affected her rights, and consequently she will conform
to the decisions that the Powers may take in conformity with
Article 25 of the Treaty of Berlin. In deference to the advice
of the Great Powers, Serbia undertakes to renounce from now
onwards the attitude of protest and opposition which she has
adopted with regard to the annexation since last autumn.
She undertakes, moreover, to modify the direction of her
policy with regard to Austria-Hungary and to live in future on
good neighbourly terms with the latter."</p>

<p>'The history of recent years, and in particular the painful
events of the 28th June last, have shown the existence of a
subversive movement with the object of detaching a part of
the territories of Austria-Hungary from the Monarchy. The
movement, which had its birth under the eye of the Serbian
Government, has gone so far as to make itself manifest on both
sides of the Serbian frontier in the shape of acts of terrorism
and a series of outrages and murders.</p>

<p>'Far from carrying out the formal undertakings contained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
in the declaration of the 31st March 1909, the Royal Serbian
Government has done nothing to repress these movements.
It has permitted the criminal machinations of various societies
and associations directed against the Monarchy, and has
tolerated unrestrained language on the part of the Press, the
glorification of the perpetrators of outrages, and the participation
of officers and functionaries in subversive agitation. It
has permitted an unwholesome propaganda in public instruction,
in short, it has permitted all manifestations of a nature
to incite the Serbian population to hatred of the Monarchy
and contempt of its institutions.</p>

<p>'This culpable tolerance of the Royal Serbian Government
had not ceased at the moment when the events of the 28th June
last proved its fatal consequences to the whole world.</p>

<p>'It results from the depositions and confessions of the
criminal perpetrators of the outrage of the 28th June that the
Serajevo assassinations were planned in Belgrade; that the
arms and explosives with which the murderers were provided
had been given to them by Serbian officers and functionaries
belonging to the Narodna Odbrana; and finally, that the
passage into Bosnia of the criminals and their arms was organised
and effected by the chiefs of the Serbian frontier service.</p>

<p>'The above-mentioned results of the magisterial investigation
do not permit the Austro-Hungarian Government to
pursue any longer the attitude of expectant forbearance which
they have maintained for years in face of the machinations
hatched in Belgrade, and thence propagated in the territories
of the Monarchy. The results, on the contrary, impose on them
the duty of putting an end to the intrigues which form a perpetual
menace to the tranquillity of the Monarchy.</p>

<p>'To achieve this end the Imperial and Royal Government
see themselves compelled to demand from the Royal Serbian
Government a formal assurance that they condemn this dangerous
propaganda against the Monarchy; in other words, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
whole series of tendencies, the ultimate aim of which is to
detach from the Monarchy territories belonging to it; and that
they undertake to suppress by every means this criminal and
terrorist propaganda.</p>

<p>'In order to give a formal character to this undertaking the
Royal Serbian Government shall publish on the front page of
their "Official Journal" of the 13th (26th) July the following
declaration:</p>

<p>'"The Royal Government of Serbia condemn the propaganda
directed against Austria-Hungary, <i>i.e.</i> the general tendency
of which the final aim is to detach from the Austro-Hungarian
Monarchy territories belonging to it, and they sincerely deplore
the fatal consequences of these criminal proceedings.</p>

<p>'"The Royal Government regret that Serbian officers and
functionaries participated in the above-mentioned propaganda
and thus compromised the good neighbourly relations to which
the Royal Government were solemnly pledged by their declaration
of the 31st March 1909.</p>

<p>'"The Royal Government, who disapprove and repudiate
all idea of interfering or attempting to interfere with the
destinies of the inhabitants of any part whatsoever of Austria-Hungary,
consider it their duty formally to warn officers and
functionaries, and the whole population of the kingdom, that
henceforward they will proceed with the utmost rigour against
persons who may be guilty of such machinations, which they
will use all their efforts to anticipate and suppress."</p>

<p>'This declaration shall simultaneously be communicated to
the Royal Army as an order of the day by His Majesty the King
and shall be published in the "Official Bulletin" of the Army.</p>

<p>'The Royal Serbian Government further undertake:</p>

<p>'1. To suppress any publication which incites to hatred
and contempt of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy and the
general tendency of which is directed against its territorial
integrity;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>'2. To dissolve immediately the society styled 'Narodna
Odbrana,' to confiscate all its means of propaganda, and to
proceed in the same manner against other societies and their
branches in Serbia which engage in propaganda against the
Austro-Hungarian Monarchy. The Royal Government shall
take the necessary measures to prevent the societies dissolved

<h3>SERBIA'S REPLY TO AUSTRIA</h3>


<p>The Royal Serbian Government have received the communication
of the Imperial and Royal Government of the
10th instant,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and are convinced that their reply will remove
any misunderstanding which may threaten to impair the good
neighbourly relations between the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy
and the Kingdom of Serbia.</p>

<p>Conscious of the fact that the protests which were made
both from the tribune of the national Skupshtina<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and in
the declarations and actions of the responsible representatives
of the State&mdash;protests which were cut short by the
declarations made by the Serbian Government on the 18th<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
March 1909&mdash;have not been renewed on any occasion as
regards the great neighbouring Monarchy, and that no attempt
has been made since that time, either by the successive Royal
Governments or by their organs, to change the political and
legal state of affairs created in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the
Royal Government draw attention to the fact that in this
connection the Imperial and Royal Government have made
no representation except one concerning a school book, and
that on that occasion the Imperial and Royal Government
received an entirely satisfactory explanation. Serbia has
several times given proofs of her pacific and moderate policy
during the Balkan crisis, and it is thanks to Serbia and to the
sacrifice that she has made in the exclusive interest of European
peace that that peace has been preserved. The Royal Government
cannot be held responsible for manifestations of a private
character, such as articles in the Press and the peaceable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
work of societies&mdash;manifestations which take place in nearly
all countries in the ordinary course of events, and which, as
a general rule, escape official control. The Royal Government
are all the less responsible, in view of the fact that at
the time of the solution of a series of questions which arose
between Serbia and Austria-Hungary they gave proof of a
great readiness to oblige, and thus succeeded in settling the
majority of these questions to the advantage of the two
neighbouring countries.</p>

<p>For these reasons the Royal Government have been pained
and surprised at the statements, according to which members
of the Kingdom of Serbia are supposed to have participated
in the preparations for the crime committed at Serajevo;
the Royal Government expected to be invited to collaborate
in an investigation of all that concerns this crime, and they
were ready, in order to prove the entire correctness of their
attitude, to take measures against any persons concerning
whom representations were made to them. Falling in, therefore,
with the desire of the Imperial and Royal Government,
they are prepared to hand over for trial any Serbian subject,
without regard to his situation or rank, of whose complicity
in the crime of Serajevo proofs are forthcoming, and more
especially they undertake to cause to be published on the
first page of the 'Journal Officiel,' on the date of the 13th
(26th) July, the following declaration:</p>

<p>'The Royal Government of Serbia condemn all propaganda
which may be directed against Austria-Hungary, that is to
say, all such tendencies as aim at ultimately detaching from
the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy territories which form part
thereof, and they sincerely deplore the baneful consequences
of these criminal movements. The Royal Government regret
that, according to the communication from the Imperial and
Royal Government, certain Serbian officers and officials should
have taken part in the above-mentioned propaganda, and thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
compromised the good neighbourly relations to which the
Royal Serbian Government was solemnly engaged by the
declaration of the 31st March 1909,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> which declaration disapproves
and repudiates all idea or attempt at interference
with the destiny of the inhabitants of any part whatsoever of
Austria-Hungary, and they consider it their duty formally to
warn the officers, officials, and entire population of the Kingdom
that henceforth they will take the most rigorous steps against
all such persons as are guilty of such acts, to prevent and to
repress which they will use their utmost endeavour.'</p>

<p>This declaration will be brought to the knowledge of the
Royal Army in an order of the day, in the name of His Majesty
the King, by His Royal Highness the Crown Prince Alexander,
and will be published in the next official Army bulletin.</p>

<p>The Royal Government further undertake:</p>

<p>1. To introduce at the first regular convocation of the
Skupshtina<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> a provision into the Press law providing for the
most severe punishment of incitement to hatred or contempt
of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, and for taking action
against any publication the general tendency of which is
directed against the territorial integrity of Austro-Hungary.
The Government engage at the approaching revision of the
Constitution to cause an amendment to be introduced into
Article 22 of the Constitution of such a nature that such publication
may be confiscated, a proceeding at present impossible
under the categorical terms of Article 22 of the Constitution.</p>

<p>2. The Government possess no proof, nor does the note of
the Imperial and Royal Government furnish them with any,
that the 'Narodna Odbrana' and other similar societies have
committed up to the present any criminal act of this nature
through the proceedings of any of their members. Nevertheless,
the Royal Government will accept the demand of the
Imperial and Royal Government, and will dissolve the 'Narodna<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
Odbrana' Society and every other society which may be
directing its efforts against Austria-Hungary.</p>

<p>3. The Royal Serbian Government undertake to remove
without delay from their public educational establishments in
Serbia all that serves or could serve to foment propaganda
against Austria-Hungary, whenever the Imperial and Royal
Government furnish them with facts and proofs of this propaganda.</p>

<p>4. The Royal Government also agree to remove from military
service all such persons as the judicial inquiry may have proved
to be guilty of acts directed against the integrity of the territory
of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, and they expect the Imperial
and Royal Government to communicate to them at a
later date the names and the acts of these officers and officials
for the purpose of the proceedings which are to be taken against
them.</p>

<p>5. The Royal Government must confess that they do not
clearly grasp the meaning or the scope of the demand made by
the Imperial and Royal Government that Serbia shall undertake
to accept the collaboration of the organs of the Imperial
and Royal Government upon their territory, but they declare
that they will admit such collaboration as agrees with the
principle of international law, with criminal procedure, and
with good neighbourly relations.</p>

<p>6. It goes without saying that the Royal Government consider
it their duty to open an inquiry against all such persons
as are, or eventually may be, implicated in the plot of the 15th
June, and who happen to be within the territory of the Kingdom.
As regards the participation in this inquiry of Austro-Hungarian
agents or authorities appointed for this purpose by the
Imperial and Royal Government, the Royal Government
cannot accept such an arrangement, as it would be a violation
of the Constitution and of the law of criminal procedure;
nevertheless, in concrete cases communications as to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
results of the investigation in question might be given to the
Austro-Hungarian agents.</p>

<p>7. The Royal Government proceeded, on the very evening
of the delivery of the note, to arrest Commandant Voislav
Tankossitch. As regards Milan Ziganovitch, who is a subject
of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy and who up to the 15th<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
June was employed (on probation) by the directorate of railways,
it has not yet been possible to arrest him.</p>

<p>The Austro-Hungarian Government are requested to be so
good as to supply as soon as possible, in the customary form,
the presumptive evidence of guilt, as well as the eventual
proofs of guilt which have been collected up to the present,
at the inquiry at Serajevo for the purposes of the later
inquiry.</p>

<p>8. The Serbian Government will reinforce and extend the
measures which have been taken for preventing the illicit traffic
of arms and explosives across the frontier. It goes without
saying that they will immediately order an inquiry and will
severely punish the frontier officials on the Schabatz-Loznitza
line who have failed in their duty and allowed the authors of
the crime of Serajevo to pass.</p>

<p>9. The Royal Government will gladly give explanations of
the remarks made by their officials, whether in Serbia or abroad,
in interviews after the crime which according to the statement
of the Imperial and Royal Government were hostile towards
the Monarchy, as soon as the Imperial and Royal Government
have communicated to them the passages in question in these
remarks, and as soon as they have shown that the remarks were
actually made by the said officials, although the Royal Government
will itself take steps to collect evidence and proofs.</p>

<p>10. The Royal Government will inform the Imperial and
Royal Government of the execution of the measures comprised
under the above heads, in so far as this has not already been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
done by the present note, as soon as each measure has been
ordered and carried out.</p>

<p>If the Imperial and Royal Government are not satisfied with
this reply, the Serbian Government, considering that it is not
to the common interest to precipitate the solution of this
question, are ready, as always, to accept a pacific understanding,
either by referring this question to the decision of the International
Tribunal of The Hague, or to the Great Powers which
took part in the drawing up of the declaration made by the
Serbian Government on the 18th (31st) March 1909.</p>

<h3>GERMANY'S DECLARATION OF WAR AGAINST RUSSIA</h3>


<p>The Note presented by Count Pourtalès, German Ambassador
at St. Petersburg, on the 1st August 1914, at 7.10 <small>P.M.</small>:</p>

<p>'The Imperial German Government have used every effort
since the beginning of the crisis to bring about a peaceful settlement.
In compliance with a wish expressed to him by His
Majesty the Emperor of Russia, the German Emperor had
undertaken, in concert with Great Britain, the part of mediator
between the cabinets of Vienna and St. Petersburg; but Russia,
without waiting for any result, proceeded to a general mobilisation
of her forces both on land and sea. In consequence of
this threatening step, which was not justified by any military
proceedings on the part of Germany, the German Empire was
faced by a grave and imminent danger. If the German Government
had failed to guard against this peril, they would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
compromised the safety and the very existence of Germany.
The German Government were, therefore, obliged to make
representations to the Government of His Majesty the Emperor
of All the Russias and to insist upon a cessation of the aforesaid
military acts. Russia having refused to comply with (not
having considered it necessary to answer<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>) this demand, and
having shown by this refusal (this attitude<a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>) that her action
was directed against Germany, I have the honour, on the instructions
of my Government, to inform your Excellency as
follows:</p>

<p>'His Majesty the Emperor, my august Sovereign, in the
name of the German Empire, accepts the challenge, and considers
himself at war with Russia.'</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="APPENDIX_IV" id="APPENDIX_IV">APPENDIX IV</a></h2>

<h3>GERMANY'S DECLARATION OF WAR AGAINST FRANCE</h3>


<p>The following letter was handed by the German Ambassador
to M. René Viviani, President of the Council, Minister for
Foreign Affairs, during his farewell audience, August 3, 1914,
at 6.45 <small>P.M.</small></p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">M. le Président</span>,</p>

<p>The German administrative and military authorities
have established a certain number of flagrantly hostile acts committed
on German territory by French military aviators.
Several of these have openly violated the neutrality of Belgium<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
by flying over the territory of that country; one has attempted
to destroy buildings near Wesel; others have been seen in the
district of the Eifel; one has thrown bombs on the railway near
Karlsruhe and Nuremberg.</p>

<p>I am instructed, and I have the honour to inform your
Excellency, that in the presence of these acts of aggression the
German Empire considers itself in a state of war with France
in consequence of the acts of this latter Power.</p>

<p>At the same time I have the honour to bring to the knowledge
of your Excellency that the German authorities will detain
French mercantile vessels in German ports, but they will release
them if, within forty-eight hours, they are assured of complete
reciprocity.</p>

<p>My diplomatic mission having thus come to an end it only
remains for me to request your Excellency to be good enough
to furnish me with my passports, and to take the steps you
consider suitable to assure my return to Germany, with the
staff of the Embassy, as well as with the staff of the Bavarian
Legation and of the German Consulate-General in Paris.</p>

<p>Be good enough, M. le Président, to receive the assurances of
my deepest respect.</p>

<h3>PRESIDENT WILSON'S FOURTEEN POINTS</h3>


<p>An excerpt from President Wilson's address to Congress on
January 8, 1918:</p>

<p>'The programme of the world's peace, therefore, is our programme,
and that programme, the only possible one as we see
it, is this:</p>

<p>'1. Open covenants of peace openly arrived at, after which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
there shall be no private international understandings of any
kind, but diplomacy shall proceed always frankly and in the
public view.</p>

<p>'2. Absolute freedom of navigation upon the seas outside
territorial waters alike in peace and in war, except as the seas
may be closed in whole or in part by international action for
the enforcement of international covenants.</p>

<p>'3. The removal, so far as possible, of all economic barriers
and the establishment of an equality of trade conditions among
all nations consenting to the peace and associating themselves
for its maintenance.</p>

<p>'4. Adequate guarantees given and taken that national
armaments will be reduced to the lowest point consistent with
domestic safety.</p>

<p>'5. A free, open-minded, and absolutely impartial adjustment
of all colonial claims, based upon a strict observance of the
principle that in determining all such questions of sovereignty
the interests of the populations concerned must have equal
weight with the equitable claims of the Government whose title
is to be determined.</p>

<p>'6. The evacuation of all Russian territory, and such a settlement
of all questions affecting Russia as will secure the best and
freest co-operation of the other nations of the world in obtaining
for her an unhampered and unembarrassed opportunity
for the independent determination of her own political development
and national policy, and assure her of a sincere welcome
into the society of free nations under institutions of her own
choosing; and more than a welcome assistance also of every
kind that she may need and may herself desire. The treatment
accorded Russia by her sister nations in the months to come will
be the acid test of their goodwill, of their comprehension of her
needs as distinguished from their own interests, and of their
intelligent and unselfish sympathy.</p>

<p>'7. Belgium, the whole world will agree, must be evacuated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
and restored without any attempt to limit the sovereignty
which she enjoys in common with all other free nations. No
other single act will serve as this will serve to restore confidence
among the nations in the laws which they have themselves set
and determined for the government of their relations with one
another. Without this healing act the whole structure and
validity of international law is for ever impaired.</p>

<p>'8. All French territory should be freed, and the invaded
portions restored, and the wrong done to France by Prussia in
1871 in the matter of Alsace-Lorraine, which has unsettled the
peace of the world for nearly fifty years, should be righted in
order that peace may once more be made secure in the interest
of all.</p>

<p>'9. A readjustment of the frontiers of Italy should be
effected along clearly recognisable lines of nationality.</p>

<p>'10. The peoples of Austria-Hungary, whose place among the
nations we wish to see safeguarded and assured, should be
accorded the first opportunity of autonomous development.</p>

<p>'11. Roumania, Serbia, and Montenegro should be evacuated,
occupied territories restored, Serbia accorded free and secure
access to the sea, and the relations of the several Balkan States
to one another determined by friendly counsel along historically
established lines of allegiance and nationality, and international
guarantees of the political and economic independence and
territorial integrity of the several Balkan States should be
entered into.</p>

<p>'12. The Turkish portions of the present Ottoman Empire
should be assured a secure sovereignty, but the other nationalities
which are now under Turkish rule should be assured an
undoubted security of life and an absolutely unmolested opportunity
of autonomous development, and the Dardanelles should
be permanently opened as a free passage to the ships and
commerce of all nations under international guarantees.</p>

<p>'13. An independent Polish State should be erected which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
should include the territories inhabited by indisputably Polish
populations, which should be assured a free and secure access
to the sea, and whose political and economic independence and
territorial integrity should be guaranteed by international
covenant.</p>

<p>'14. A general association of nations must be formed under
specific covenants for the purpose of affording mutual guarantees
of political and territorial independence for great and small
States alike.'</p>

<p>Allied and United States troops shall enter these various
territories on the expiration of the period allowed to the German
troops for the evacuation of each.</p>

<p>In consequence the Allied troops will cross the present German
front as from the sixth day following the signing of the Armistice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
line No. 1 as from the tenth day, and line No. 2 as from the
sixteenth day.</p>

<p>2. <i>Evacuation of the Rhine District.</i>&mdash;This evacuation will
also be carried out in several successive stages:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">(1) Evacuation of territories situated between lines 2 and 3
and line 4, to be completed within four further days
(nineteen days in all after the signing of the Armistice).</p>

<p class="hanging">(2) Evacuation of territories situated between lines 4 and 5
to be completed within four further days (twenty-three
days in all after the signing of the Armistice).</p>

<p class="hanging">(3) Evacuation of territories situated between lines 5 and 6
(line of the Rhine) to be completed within four further
days (twenty-seven days in all after the signing of
the Armistice).</p>

<p class="hanging">(4) Evacuation of the bridgeheads and of the neutral zone
on the right bank of the Rhine to be completed within
four further days (thirty-one days in all after the
signing of the Armistice).</p></blockquote>

<p>The Allied and United States Army of Occupation shall enter
these various territories after the expiration of the period allowed
to the German troops for the evacuation of each, consequently
the Army will cross the line No. 3 twenty days after signing of
the Armistice, it will cross line No. 4 as from the twenty-fourth
day after the signing of the Armistice. Line No. 5 as from the
twenty-eighth day. Line No. 6 (Rhine) the thirty-second day
in order to occupy the bridgeheads.</p>

<p>3. <i>Surrender by the German Army of War Material specified in
the Armistice.</i>&mdash;This war material shall be surrendered according
to the following conditions: The first half before the tenth day,
the second half before the twentieth day. This material will
be handed over to each of the Allied and United States Armies

<h3><span class="smcap">Parts II and III</span></h3>

<p class="center"><i>The Boundaries of Germany and Political Clauses for Europe</i></p>

<p>The Western Boundary of Germany:&mdash;On the Belgian border
Germany admits the full sovereignty of Belgium over the
contested territory of Moresnet and over part of Prussian
Moresnet. Germany also renounces all rights over Eupen and
Malmedy. Luxemburg passes from the sphere of German
influence. From Luxemburg southwards, the boundary of
France is her boundary previous to the war of 1870, Lorraine
and Alsace being thus restored to her. With regard to the
Saar Basin, on the north-east frontier of Lorraine, there are
special provisions. As compensation for the destruction of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
the coal mines in Northern France, and in part payment of
the total reparation due, Germany cedes to France all the coal
mines there situated, while she hands over the government of
the territory to the League of Nations. After fifteen years the
inhabitants of the territory are to declare by secret vote the
sovereignty under which they desire to be placed, and if, in
accordance with their will, the territory be returned to Germany,
the mines must be purchased from France by Germany at a
price to be fixed by a board of experts. As a guarantee for
the execution of the treaty, the German territory west of the
Rhine (<i>i.e.</i> north of the point where the French boundary
leaves the Rhine), together with the Rhine bridgeheads, will
remain in the occupation of the Allies, part of it for five years,
part of it for ten years, and the remainder for fifteen years. At
the end of these periods stipulated portions will be evacuated
subject to the faithful performance by Germany of her
pledges.</p>

<p>Germany is forbidden fortifications and constructions of
military use within fifty kilometres of the east bank of the
Rhine.</p>

<p>The Southern Boundary of Germany:&mdash;With Switzerland,
the present frontier. With Austria, the frontier of the 3rd
August 1914, from Switzerland to Czecho-Slovakia. With
Czecho-Slovakia, the Austro-German frontier in this area
of the 3rd August 1914, to a point eight kilometres east of
Neustadt.</p>

<p>The Eastern Boundary of Germany:&mdash;Almost all of West
Prussia and Posen go to Poland. Danzig with the territory
round it becomes a free city. A portion of East Prussia is left
to Germany, but its northern corner is taken from her and the
fate of a southern portion is left for decision by plebiscite.
The fate of a part of Upper Silesia is also left for decision by
plebiscite.</p>

<p>The boundary between Germany and Denmark depends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
upon the will of the inhabitants of northern and central
Schleswig. The nationality of the inhabitants of this territory
is left for decision by plebiscite.</p>

<p>Heligoland will be rendered harmless by the destruction of
all fortifications, harbours, etc.</p>

<p>Russia:&mdash;Germany abrogates the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk
and all agreements with the Maximalist Government of Russia.
The Allied Powers reserve on behalf of Russia her right to
obtain from Germany reparation.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Part IV</span></h3>

<p class="center"><i>German Rights and Interests outside Germany</i></p>

<p>In territory outside her European frontiers, as fixed by the
Treaty, Germany renounces all previous rights and titles.</p>

<p>She hands over her colonies, with all Government or State
property therein, unconditionally to the Allied Powers. She
undertakes to pay reparation for damage suffered by French
nationals in the Cameroons through the acts of Germans
between 1st January 1900 and 1st August 1914.</p>

<p>Her possessions and rights in China she restores to China
except in the province of Shantung, in the British concession
at Canton, and in the French concession at Shanghai; China
in turn agrees to open certain restored areas to international
residence and trade. In Shantung Germany hands over the
territory of Kiao-Chow and all her rights and property to Japan;
in Canton she renounces her State property in favour of Great
Britain; she hands over the German school in Shanghai to
France and China jointly.</p>

<p>Her rights, property, privileges, etc., in Siam, Siberia, and
Morocco she renounces in favour of Siam, Siberia, and Morocco
respectively.</p>

<p>She recognises the British Protectorate over Egypt declared
on the 18th December 1914, and undertakes not to intervene<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
in any negotiations in respect of Egypt between Great Britain
and other powers.</p>

<p>She undertakes to recognise and accept all arrangements
which the Allied Powers may make with Turkey and Bulgaria
with reference to German interests.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Part V</span></h3>

<p class="center"><i>Military, Naval, and Aerial Clauses</i></p>

<p>'In order to render possible the initiation of a general limitation
of the armaments of all nations, Germany undertakes
directly to observe the military, naval, and air clauses which
follow.'</p>

<h4>MILITARY</h4>

<p>The Military terms provide for the demobilisation of the
German armies and the imposition of other military restrictions,
within two months of the signing of the Treaty (as the
first step towards international disarmament). All compulsory
military service is to be abolished in German territory,
and recruiting regulations on a voluntary basis are to be incorporated
into the German military laws, providing for the
enlistment of non-commissioned officers and men for a period
of not less than twelve consecutive years, and stipulating that
officers shall serve for twenty-five years, and shall not be
retired until the age of forty-five. No reserve of officers with
war service will be permitted. The total number of German
effectives is fixed at one hundred thousand, including not more
than four thousand officers, and it is provided that there shall
be no other military forces raised outside this figure. Increase
in the number of customs, forestry officials or police, or the
military training of these services is specially prohibited.</p>

<p>The function of the German Army is to keep internal order
and control of frontiers. The High Command is to confine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
itself to administrative duties, and it will not be allowed to
retain a General Staff. Civilian personnel at the Ministry of
War and similar institutions is to be reduced to one-tenth of
that in 1913. There will be not more than seven Infantry and
three Cavalry Divisions, and not more than two Corps Staffs.
Surplus war academies, and schools for officers, cadets, etc.,
are to be suppressed, and the number of students admitted to
the schools retained for the recruitment of officers is to be
limited to the vacancies occurring in the establishments provided.
The production of armaments, munitions, and material
of war in Germany is limited to a schedule, based on the amount
considered necessary for an army on the scale decided upon.
No reserves may be formed, and all existing armaments, guns,
and stores above the limit fixed must be handed over to the
Allies for disposal. No poisonous gas or liquid fire shall be
manufactured or imported, nor any tanks nor armoured cars.
The Germans are obliged to notify to the Allies for approval
the names and situation of all factories manufacturing munitions,
together with particulars of their output. The German
Government arsenals are to be suppressed and their personnel
dismissed. Munitions for use in fortified works will be limited
to 1500 rounds apiece for guns of 10·5 cm. calibre and under,
and 500 rounds for guns of a higher calibre. Germany is prohibited
from manufacturing armaments and munitions for
foreign countries and from importing them from abroad.
Germany must not maintain or construct any fortifications
situated on German territory less than fifty kilometres east of
the Rhine, and in the above area no armed forces either permanent
or temporary may be maintained. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">status quo</i> is
to be reserved in respect of the fortifications on the original
southern and eastern frontiers of the German Empire. No
military manœuvres may be held nor any permanent works
kept for the purposes of helping mobilisation. The demobilisation
of fortifications must take place within three months.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>


<h4>NAVAL</h4>

<p>The Naval terms provide that within two months the German
naval forces in commission must not exceed six battleships
of the <i>Deutschland</i> or <i>Lothringen</i> type, six light cruisers,
twelve destroyers, and twelve torpedo boats, or an equal
number of ships constructed to replace them. No submarines
are to be included, and all other warships are to be placed in
reserve or devoted to commercial purposes. Germany may
keep in commission a fixed number of mine-sweeping vessels
until the mines within certain specified areas in the North Sea
and Baltic have been swept up. After the expiration of two
months the total exclusive personnel of the Navy must not
exceed 15,000, including a maximum of 1500 officers and
warrant officers. All German surface warships interned in
Allied or neutral ports are to be finally surrendered. Within
two months certain additional warships enumerated in the
Treaty and now in German ports will be surrendered at Allied
ports. The German Government must undertake the breaking-up
of all German surface warships under construction. Auxiliary
cruisers, etc., are to be disarmed and treated as merchant
ships. Within one month all German submarines, salvage
vessels, and docks for submarines capable of proceeding under
their own power or being towed must have been handed over
at Allied ports. The remainder and those under construction
must be broken up by Germany within three months.</p>

<p>Material arising from the breaking-up of German warships
may not be used except for industrial purposes, and may not
be sold to foreign countries. Except under specified conditions
for replacement, Germany is forbidden to construct or acquire
any warships, and the construction or acquisition of any submarines
whatever is prohibited. Vessels of war are only to
have a fixed allowance of arms, munitions, and war material.
All excess of arms, munitions and war material is to be surrendered,
and no stocks or reserves are allowed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>The personnel of the German navy must be recruited entirely
by voluntary engagements for a minimum period of twenty-five
consecutive years for officers and warrant officers, and twelve
consecutive years for petty officers and men, under various
restrictions.</p>

<p>In order to ensure free passage into the Baltic Germany is not
to erect any fortifications in certain specified areas, nor to install
any guns commanding maritime routes between the North Sea
and the Baltic. Existing fortifications within those areas are
to be demolished and guns removed. Other fortified works
within fifty kilometres of the German coast or on German islands
are to remain, as being of a defensive nature, but no new fortifications
may be constructed and the armaments may not be
increased. The maximum stocks of ammunition allowed for
such defences are 1500 rounds per piece for 4·1 inch guns and
under, and 500 rounds per piece for guns exceeding that
calibre.</p>

<p>The German wireless stations at Nauen, Hanover, and Berlin
are not to be used for naval, military, or political messages
without the assent of the Allied and Associated Governments
during three months, but only for commercial purposes, under
supervision. During the same period Germany is not to build
any more high-power wireless stations.</p>


<h4>AERIAL</h4>

<p>The Air clauses provide that the armed forces of Germany
must not include any military or naval air forces. Germany is,
however, to be allowed to maintain a maximum of 100 unarmed
seaplanes up to the 1st October 1919, to be exclusively employed
in searching for submarine mines. The entire personnel of the
air forces in Germany is to be demobilised within two months,
except for a total of 1000 men, including officers, which may be
retained up to October 1919.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>Until the complete evacuation of German territory by the
Allies and Associated troops, the aircraft of the Allied and
Associated Powers shall enjoy in Germany freedom of passage
through the air, freedom of transit and of landing.</p>

<p>All military and naval aircraft (including dirigibles) and
aeronautical material are to be delivered to the Allied and
Associated Governments within three months, except for the
hundred seaplanes already specified.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Part VI</span></h3>

<p class="center"><i>Prisoners of War and Graves</i></p>

<p>The Allied and Associated Powers agree to repatriate German
prisoners and interned civilians without delay after the coming
in force of the present Treaty; the whole cost of repatriation
to be borne by the German Government.</p>

<p>The Allied Governments and the German Government will
cause to be respected and maintained the graves of the soldiers
and sailors buried in their respective territories.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Part VII</span></h3>

<p class="center"><i>Penalties</i></p>

<p>William II., of Hohenzollern, formerly German Emperor, to be
tried by a special tribunal for a supreme offence against international
morality and the sanctity of treaties. The tribunal
to consist of five judges, one appointed by each of the following
powers: the U.S.A., Great Britain, France, Italy, and Japan.</p>

<p>The German Government recognises the right of the Allied
Powers to bring before military tribunals persons accused of
having committed acts in violation of the laws and customs of
war and agrees to hand over such persons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Part VIII</span></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Reparation</span></p>

<p>'The Allied and Associated Governments affirm, and Germany
accepts on behalf of herself and her Allies, the responsibility for
causing all the loss and damage to which the Allied and Associated
Governments and their nationals have been subjected as a
consequence of the war imposed upon them by the aggression
of Germany and her Allies.'</p>

<p>The Allied and Associated Governments recognise that the
resources of Germany are insufficient to make complete reparation
possible, but through the instrumentality of an Inter-Allied
commission, to be called the Reparation Commission, her
responsibility for the loss and damage caused by the war is to
be assessed and gradually liquidated as far as possible.</p>

<p>As a first instalment Germany must pay to the Allies, in such
form and by such instalments as the Reparation Commission
may determine, the equivalent of 20,000,000,000 gold marks
by the 1st May 1921, and as a second instalment the equivalent
of 40,000,000,000 marks between 1921 and 1926. The question
of further instalments is reserved.</p>

<p>The Reparation Commission shall have power to examine
periodically Germany's system of taxation with a view to estimating
her capacity to pay, and the sums for reparation shall
become a charge upon all her revenues prior to that for the
service or discharge of any domestic loan.</p>

<p>A special provision is made for the repayment by Germany
of all sums which Belgium has borrowed from the Allies during
the War.</p>

<p><i>Shipping.</i>&mdash;The German Government recognises the right of
the Allies to the replacement, ton for ton and class for class, of all
merchant ships and fishing boats lost or damaged owing to the war,
and agrees to cede to the Allies all German merchant ships of
1600 tons gross and upwards, one-half of her ships between 1600<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
and 1000 tons gross, and one-quarter of her steam trawlers and
other fishing boats. These ships are to be delivered within two
months to the Reparation Commission together with documents
of title evidencing the transfer of the ships from encumbrance.</p>

<p>'As an additional part of reparation, the German Government
further agrees to build merchant ships for the account of
the Allies to the amount of not exceeding 200,000 tons gross
annually during the next five years.'</p>

<p>Specified submarine cables are renounced by Germany in
favour of the Allies, their value to be estimated and written off
the account for reparation.</p>

<p>Among special provisions is an undertaking by Germany to
furnish the University of Louvain with manuscripts, printed
books, and objects of collection 'corresponding in number and
value to those destroyed in the burning by Germany of the
Library of Louvain.'</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Part IX</span></h3>

<p class="center"><i>Financial Clauses</i></p>

<p>Any Power to which German territory is ceded will normally
assume in respect thereof a fair portion of the German pre-war
debt, the amount to be fixed in each case in accordance with
certain stated principles by the Reparation Commission. But
France shall have no liability for German debt in respect of
Alsace-Lorraine.</p>

<p>The value of German Government property in ceded territory
will normally be credited to Germany on account of reparation;
but no credit will be given for any German Government property
in Alsace-Lorraine; nor will Mandatory Powers either assume
any portion of Germany's pre-war debts or give any credits for
German Government property.</p>

<p>Germany is required to pay the total cost of the Armies of
Occupation from the date of the Armistice for so long as they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
maintained on German territory. This cost is a first charge on
her resources; the next charge is for reparation.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Part X</span></h3>

<p class="center"><i>Economic Clauses</i></p>

<p>These are designed to prevent Germany for a period of years
from discriminating against the trade of Allied and Associated
countries. They also provide for the settlement of pre-war
debts, and other obligations and rules are drawn up for the fulfilment
or non-fulfilment of pre-war contracts.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Part</span> XI</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Aerial Navigation</i></p>

<p>The provisions under this heading give to aircraft of the
Allied and Associated countries certain specified rights in
German territory and privileges similar to those enjoyed by
German aircraft.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Part XII</span></h3>

<p class="center"><i>Ports, Waterways, and Railways</i></p>

<p>Germany undertakes to grant complete freedom and equality
of transport through her territories for persons and goods passing
from or to the territories of any of the Allied and Associated
countries, such goods in transit to be exempt from all customs
and similar duties.</p>

<p>Similarly she grants to the Allied and Associated Powers
equal freedom of navigation in all her ports and waterways.
Free zones in German ports are to be maintained and adequate
facilities are to be provided for trade requirements without
distinction of nationality.</p>

<p>Portions of the Elbe, the Oder, the Niemen, and the Danube
are declared international and placed under the supervision
of the League of Nations and of International Commissions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>Provision is made for a deep draught Rhine-Danube Canal
should it be decided to construct it.</p>

<p>The Rhine and the Moselle form the subject of a special series
of clauses. With regard to the Rhine, France, to whom
Germany is to hand over a portion of her shipping on that
river, is given special rights and privileges.</p>

<p>Provision is made for a Rhine-Meuse Canal, should Belgium
desire to construct it.</p>

<p>Exit to the north is given to the Czecho-Slovak State by the
grant of a special use of the ports of Hamburg and Stettin.</p>

<p>Certain provisions are made with regard to railway service
in Germany and in transferred territory.</p>

<p>The Kiel Canal is to remain free and open to ships of war and
merchant shipping of all nations. If Germany fails to carry
out the stipulations with regard to the Canal, appeal may be
made against her to the jurisdiction of the League of Nations.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Part XIII</span></h3>

<p class="center"><i>Labour</i></p>

<p>It is provided that an International Conference shall meet
annually to propose Labour reforms for adoption by States
composing the League of Nations. The Annual Conference
will consist of four representatives from each State, two for
the State and one each for employers and employed. The
Conference has certain powers for the initiation of legislation
to fulfil recommendations or draft conventions carried by a
two-thirds majority of the delegates representing its Members.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Part XIV</span></h3>

<p class="center"><i>Guarantees</i></p>

<p>These consist chiefly of the measures already outlined for the
occupation by the Allied Powers during a period of years of the
German territories west of the Rhine. If Germany fails to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
fulfil her obligations, such occupation may be prolonged or,
if the territories or any part of them have been evacuated,
renewed.</p>



<h3><span class="smcap">Part XV</span></h3>

<p class="center"><i>Miscellaneous Provisions</i></p>

<p>'Germany undertakes to recognise the full force of the
Treaties of Peace and Additional Conventions which may be
concluded by the Allied and Associated Powers with the Powers
who fought on the side of Germany, and to recognise whatever
dispositions may be made concerning the territories of the
former Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, of the Kingdom of Bulgaria,
and of the Ottoman Empire, and to recognise the new
States within their frontiers as there laid down.'</p>

<p>An agreement about to be made between France and
Switzerland and a recent agreement between France and
Monico are formally recognised.</p>

<p>Provision is made for the continuance of the work of German
missions in transferred territories under the control of trustees
appointed by the Allied and Associated Governments.</p>

<p>Another provision ensures the acceptance by Germany of
the rulings of Allied Prize Courts.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
